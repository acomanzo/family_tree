# Family Tree
An Android app for creating, editing, and sharing family trees.
## Features
- Create a family tree
- View your family trees
- Create a user account and login
- Share your family trees with other users
- Add and remove family members, edit family members
- Add direct ancestors and descendants for specific family members
- Add important information to family members like medical history
## Purpose
- To gain experience with Android programming and full stack development (click [here](https://github.com/acomanzo/family_tree_backend) for the backend repository)
- To practice using AGILE
- To practice designing a system
- I gave a [workshop](https://github.com/UAlbany-IEEE-Student-Branch/Fall-2020-Workshop-7-App) on Android development to the UAlbany IEEE Student Chapter and this project is extending the work I completed for that
- My software engineering professor gave us the **option** to individually work on a personal project as part of the course
